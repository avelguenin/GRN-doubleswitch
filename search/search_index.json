I simulate on the left panel below the dynamics of the double toggle switch for symmetric self-activation strength, while forcing the (+,-,+) state from 0h to 100h then the (-,+,-) state from 500 to 600h in simulation time. As is visible, the system is able to retain the (+,-,+) state without external stimuli, but not the (-,+,-) state. This is because, with parameters at ecological levels (as specified in Herbach et al, 2017 ), endogenous variations of the central gene activation are strong enough to inhibit lateral genes. In other words, there is no scale separation in ecological settings, and the functional dynamics of the system cannot be decoupled from expression noise. Rather than tweaking expression parameters at the expense of biological meaning, I could implement bistability by strengthening central gene self-activation, as shown in the right panel above. Noise susceptibility It is necessary for implementing memory that the system be able to change state if and only if it is exposed to relevant stimuli. I tested this condition by testing the system's ability to withstand weak but constant stimuli, and transcient but strong stimuli. The results suggest that a state transition may be triggered by a transcient stimuli if and only if it is strong enough, and by a weak stimuli if and only in it is long enough. It follows that, even in the absence of scale separation, the double toggle switch is able to discriminate and retain relevant information. Equilibration While not central to the function of memory, it is relevant to ask whether the system has the same ability to retain different informations through time. I therefore plotted in the left panel below the heatmap of protein population for central and lateral genes while exposing the system to periodic forced transition. It is manifest that the system spends more time in the (-,+,-) state, while it is exposed to a symmetrical stimuli. This could easily be adjusted by lowering central gene self-activation, as presented in the right panel above. Dimensionality It is also relevant to ask whether the system follows other dynamics in addition to the two-state memory it was expected to implement. I therefore plotted the heatmap of the activation level for central and lateral genes for the same periodic forced transition used to study equilibration. While the activation pattern is not symetric, it is clear it follows an oblique line in log space. Its activity is therefore one-dimensional, and there are no dynamics relevant to the system beside those of its two-state memory.","title":"Analysis"},{"location":"analysis/#analysing-the-memory-properties-of-the-grn-double-toggle-switch","text":"","title":"Analysing the memory properties of the GRN\u00a0double toggle switch"},{"location":"analysis/#bistability","text":"The very first condition to the implementation of memory is the ability to retain different states through time.

I have implemented computationally an ecologically realist model of the pattern, introducted a discretised model of its functional dynamics, and showed that the absence of scale separation between functional dynamics and expression noise in ecological settings did not constrain the system's ability to discriminate information and retain it through time. Further study could deepen the discretised model I have introduced, for exemple by investigating whether a discretised scale exists where the system can be modelled as Markovian.

This paper defines a two states model of gene activation, with three chemical stages involved in expression (genetic activation, mARN density, protein density), as is represented below. I mainly diverge in my explicit separation of self-activation and extrinsic stimulation in gene activation, which is necessary in my attempt to study in silico interaction dynamics but not in their analytical inference of activation dynamics from in vivo data. All of these reaction are stochastic events with constant rates and can easily be modelled at a high level of fidelity with the classical Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie, 1976) . Because mARN and protein population are high, it is possible to approximate their variation to be deterministic without loss of information. This turns the dynamic model of a single gene's expression in the Piecewise-Determistic Markov Process defined below (where E, M, and P respectively traduce gene activation state, mARN population, and protein population). As is manifest below, our approximation does not differ significantly from the dynamics of the pure stochastic model. Modelling gene interaction As genetic modulation was shown to relate more closely to peak frequency than to peak intensity (Vi\u00f1uelas et al, 2013) , I choose to implement gene interaction as a modulation of the gene activation paramater. I use as is classical a Hill function as defined below. Diverging from Herbach et al, 2017 , I model the activation parameter as a multicative function of all protein populations. I include an additive perturbation term, which will mainly serve to force transition in silico rather than to model any existing relation. In the following equation, each protein can be shown to have no effect on basal activation when its population is well below an interaction threshold term (S), and to multiply it by the exponential of an interaction strength term (theta) when it is well above. Building the double toggle switch My goal is to study the ability of a gene regulatory pattern with a double toggle switch structure, as is represented below, to implement memory. To retain tractability with the classical toggle switch pattern, I impose symmetry in all properties of lateral genes (both intrinsic and relative to their interaction with the central gene). I also impose that the interaction strength of the cental gene onto the laterals is equal to their added retroaction. The problem then reduces to 7 parameters, as represented below, each traducting essentiel properties of the interaction dynamics. Far from state transitions, each activation term is either high or low. The system's behaviour can therefore be decoupled into two scales : the funtional scale of discrete equilibrium represented below ; and the scale of noise in gene expression. My strategy for building the toggle switch follows straightforwardly : I adapt terms from Herbach et al, 2017 to maximise the occurence of desirable transitions, and minimise the occurence of undesirable transitions.","title":"Implementation"},{"location":"implementation/#implementing-the-grn-double-toggle-switch-model","text":"","title":"Implementing the GRN double toggle switch model"},{"location":"implementation/#modelling-gene-expression","text":"The basic dynamics of gene expression are adapted from Herbach et al, 2017 .
