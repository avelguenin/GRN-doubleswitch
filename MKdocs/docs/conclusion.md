In this study, I have studied extensively the ability of the double toggle switch pattern to implement memory in gene regulatory networks. I have implemented computationally an ecologically realist model of the pattern, introducted a discretised model of its functional dynamics, and showed that the absence of scale separation between functional dynamics and expression noise in ecological settings did not constrain the system's ability to discriminate information and retain it through time. Further study could deepen the discretised model I have introduced, for exemple by investigating whether a discretised scale exists where the system can be modelled as Markovian.
